  review text: Gnibl are wonderful at tailoring our healthy snack boxes. They listen
    to what we like and what works well for us and keep those items in the box but
    also make great suggestions for new things to try. We are never disappointed with
    what we receive.

  review text: The Gnibl offering is just what we needed as it is healthy. The staff
    love the variety and the prices are competitive. We also love that there is a
    change of items to bring in new ones. Together with fabulous service, Gnibl is
    a great choice.
