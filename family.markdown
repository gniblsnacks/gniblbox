  review text: Gnibl are wonderful at tailoring our healthy snack boxes. They listen
    to what we like and what works well for us and keep those items in the box but
    also make great suggestions for new things to try. We are never disappointed with
    what we receive.

  review text: The Gnibl offering is just what we needed as it is healthy. The staff
    love the variety and the prices are competitive. We also love that there is a
    change of items to bring in new ones. Together with fabulous service, Gnibl is
    a great choice.

    weekly, fortnightly or monthly. A Gnibl Box will include a range of different

    ability to boost the brain for a full day of productivity. New snacks are included
    in each delivery which makes the Gnibl Box the most exciting thing to happen to
    snack time since sliced bread! '
- question: How Many Snacks Come in Each Box?
  answer text: 'Home Boxes come in 3 sizes: The **Small Box (10 snacks)**, The **Medium
    Box (20 snacks)** and the **Family Box (30 snacks)**'
- question: What About Billing / Shipping & Delivery / Returns ?

    **Shipping & Delivery** - We will ship your first box within 2-3 business days of receiving your order. Your regular boxes will be delivered according to the schedule you request - weekly, fortnightly or monthly.

    We deliver Australia wide for FREE to all major metropolitan centres. If you live outside Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, or Adelaide, please get in touch and we'll provide a quote for delivery to your area.

- question: " How can I change or cancel my order?"
  answer text: |-
    You can cancel your recurring deliveries at any time by giving us a call, or sending an email to <info@gnibl.com.au>. If we have already packed and dispatched your box before we receive your request, that box will be your final charge.

    We require five (5) business days’ notice to cancel or make changes to your shipment.
- question: " Can I try just one box?"
  answer text: 'If you’re not ready to commit, that''s OK! You can try one of our
    single boxes and see how you go. Single Boxes are also perfect for meetings, or
    team rewards. Check out the single box options [here](http://gniblbox.com.au/boxes). '
- question: What if I don’t like some of the snacks?
  answer text: 'If you ever receive anything you don''t LOVE, let us know and we’ll
    make sure you don’t ever receive that snack again. '
- question: What is the free Honesty Box?
  answer text: With all our subscriptions plans, we can include a free honesty box
    for you to use. It's a little cardboard money box which sits next to your Gnibl
    Box and allows you to share the cost of the snacks with your team. The box has
    a place for you to write a suggested contribution e.g. $2. It's a great way for
    small teams to jump start their health kick.
